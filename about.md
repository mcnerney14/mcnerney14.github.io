I am currently a Delta Air Lines pilot on the Boeing 737 and I love my job :).  I hold three type ratings (B-737, EA 500, and CL-65) and have instrument, single-engine, and multi-engine instructors ratings. It’s a lot of fun to learn and teach people skills that we are both excited about.

Previously I got my Master’s in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering and I get excited learning how systems operate! I want to understand as much as possible about the planes I have the privilege to fly. I was able to go from private pilot to airline pilot in under a year without any checkride failures and my students have been successful as well. 

I offer one on one ground instruction for private, commercial, instrument, instructor, airline transport pilot, and Eclipse type ratings. Send me an email and we’ll set up a time and ensure you won’t fail your oral exam. 

If I am not in the sky, I’m likely exploring the mountains. Skiing, biking, climbing, hiking, or really whatever activity enables me to get outside.
